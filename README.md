### Interactive Probabilistic Bar Chart

This visualization shows annual means with uncertainty (SEM) and colors each bar
by the probability that the underlying distribution exceeds a user-defined threshold.

The goal is to make uncertainty and sensitivity to thresholds explicit,
rather than presenting binary comparisons.

Inspired by Ferreira et al. (2014).
